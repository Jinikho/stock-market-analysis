# Project Name: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze and predict stock market trends, providing valuable business insights through data analysis and predictive modeling. The project focuses on the Swedish stock market, specifically using data from Yahoo Finance.

### Key Objectives
1. **Collect historical stock data** using the Yahoo Finance API.
2. **Analyze and visualize stock trends** to extract actionable insights.
3. **Compare volatility** against industry peers to understand risk levels.
4. **Identify seasonal patterns** for strategic buy/sell timing.
5. **Build predictive models** to forecast future stock prices and inform business decisions.

## Business Questions Addressed
### 1. What are the trends in stock price movements over the past year, and how do they correlate with major economic events?
   - **Approach**: Analyze stock prices over the past year and correlate them with key economic events using data visualization tools.

### 2. What is the stock's volatility, and how does it compare to industry peers?
   - **Approach**: Calculate and compare the standard deviation of returns to understand the stock's risk profile in relation to its peers.

### 3. Is there a seasonal pattern or trend in the stock prices that can inform optimal buying or selling times?
   - **Approach**: Perform time-series analysis to detect seasonal trends in stock prices over multiple years.

### 4. How might the stock prices move in the future, and what strategies can be optimized based on these predictions?
   - **Approach**: Build and visualize predictive models using historical data to forecast future trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** with libraries such as:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical calculations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `statsmodels` for statistical analysis
- **yfinance** for data collection from Yahoo Finance
- **Predictive modeling** tools like ARIMA or machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM) for forecasting

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Create a Python script (`src/data_collection.py`) that fetches historical stock data and saves it to a CSV file in the `data/` folder.
2. **Data Processing**: Develop a script (`src/data_cleaning.py`) to clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use a Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to analyze trends, visualize data, and answer business questions.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement a model to forecast future stock prices and visualize these predictions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
   cd stock-market-analysis
2. Install Required Packages:
   Use requirements.txt to install the necessary packages:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run the Data Collection Script
1. Run the data collection script to fetch stock data:
    - python src/data_collection.py
2. When prompted, enter the stock symbol (e.g., ^OMX for OMX Stockholm 30) and optionally provide the start and end dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Directory Structure
- data/: Contains the stock_data.csv file, where fetched stock data is saved.
- src/: Contains the source code, including data_collection.py for fetching stock data and data_cleaning.py for data preprocessing.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and analysis.
- reports/: Visualizations, reports, or analysis summaries.
